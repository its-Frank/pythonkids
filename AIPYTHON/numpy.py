- NumPy is short for "Numerical Python".
- NumPy: Awesome for math and numbers.
'''
#### How to Use NumPy
'''
- Install it (just once):
  - In a terminal, type: `pip install numpy`.
- Then use it in your code!
'''
#### NumPy Example: Playing with Numbers
import numpy as np  # Load the math toolkit

numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Make a list of numbers
print("Numbers:", numbers)
print("Triple:", numbers * 3)         # Triple every number
print("Sum:", np.sum(numbers))        # Add them all up


#Explanation:
'''
- `np.array()` creates a special list.
- `numbers * 3` multiplies every number at once.
- `np.sum()` adds everything together.
